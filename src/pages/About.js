                    UnityUprise aims to build a bridge between NGOs (Non-Governmental
                    Organizations) and stray animals by creating a platform that facilitates collaboration and welfare
                    initiatives. We strive to improve the lives of stray animals by connecting them with caring
                    individuals, organizations, and volunteers who can offer support and aid in their rescue,
                    rehabilitation, and adoption.
